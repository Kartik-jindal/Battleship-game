# Battleship Game

Welcome to the Battleship game! This project features a console-based implementation allowing users to engage in a strategic battle against an AI opponent. Players take turns guessing the coordinates of each other's battleships until one successfully sinks the opponent's ship or the game reaches a specified turn limit.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/battleship-game.git
# How to Play
The game board is a 5x5 grid.
Participants take turns guessing the coordinates of the AI's battleship.
The AI reciprocates by attempting to guess the coordinates of the player's battleship.
The game concludes when a player successfully sinks the opponent's battleship or when the maximum allowed turns are exhausted.
# Rules
Input guesses using row and column coordinates (both ranging from 1 to 5).
A correct guess of the AI's battleship location results in a win.
The AI also endeavors to locate the player's battleship.
Victory is achieved if either the player or the AI successfully sinks the opponent's battleship.
In case the maximum turn limit is reached, the winner is determined by the player with the most successful hits. A tie results in a draw.
